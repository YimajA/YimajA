# Reverse Engineering Android Apps

## Objective
This project focused on reverse engineering Android applications to understand their underlying code structure, behavior, and potential vulnerabilities. The project involved decompiling APK files, analyzing code, and identifying security flaws.

### Skills Learned
- Advanced understanding of Android app architecture and code.
- Proficiency in using tools like JADX and Android Studio for decompiling and analyzing Android apps.
- Ability to identify and exploit security vulnerabilities in Android applications.
- Enhanced knowledge of mobile security and reverse engineering techniques.

### Tools Used
- **JADX:** Decompiled APK files to analyze the underlying code.
- **Android Studio:** Provided an environment for testing and debugging Android apps.
- **Frida:** Used for dynamic analysis of Android applications.
