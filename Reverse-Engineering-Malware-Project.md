# Reverse Engineering Malware Project

## Objective
This project involved reverse-engineering a variety of malware samples to understand their behavior, attack mechanisms, and potential impact on systems. The primary goal was to gain hands-on experience with reverse engineering tools and techniques.

### Skills Learned
- Advanced understanding of reverse engineering concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in disassembling and debugging malware binaries.
- Ability to analyze and interpret low-level code.
- Enhanced knowledge of malware behavior and potential system impacts.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used
- **IDA Pro:** Disassembled malware binaries for code analysis.
- **OllyDBG:** Debugged malware to observe runtime behavior.
- **Wireshark:** Monitored network traffic generated by the malware.
